# Haveyousin - React (create react app ejected) , Mobx , soon firebase


Haveyousin consums The Movie Database API (TMDB) to get **feed** of movies and **search**. 

The aim of the application is to **receive a feed of movies** currently in movie theaters or soon to be released and then you can add it to lists of movie you want to see.


The lists : 
* default lists:
    * to watch list (default)
    * favorites
    * archive 
* customs: you create yourself lists (ex: halloween, christmas)

**Currently the lists are saved in local storage**, I'll soon use firebase database in order to get the lists on every user's device.
